The Vitamin Lamp is evaluated as providing the highest performance for over three years.LED lighting reduces energy consumption up to 70%. It is an eco-friendly lighting with 5 times longer life span than the conventional lighting. LED lighting was introduced 20 years ago but the market penetration has not yet reached 20%.The LED technology limitation on heat problem is at the center of the slow adoption of LED lighting. The heat problem was resolved for indoor lighting and now it is possible to simply replace the bulb. Outdoor lighting, however, generates 40 times more heat to generate 20 times brighter light than indoor light.

So, the remaining 80% of the market has not converted to LED and end up purchasing 30% of regular lighting fixtures every year.At BKT, we have come up with HS FRAME technology and solved the central age-old LED issue.Our technology is based on the semiconductor lead frame process and integrated LED chip, PCB and heat sink into the single HS FRAME. HS FRAME has a simplified design that transfers heat and current without solder, releases heat 10 times faster and maintains 30% lower temperature.In the case of conventional LED technology we have replaced, LED chip, PCB and heat sink are separated from each other.

In LED lighting, it is a key material that transfers heat as well as current. But, solder has not only a low thermal conductivity but also is sensitive to temperature change. Solder often breaks because its volume expands at lower temperature and causes a durability issue for the product.Moreover, the fact that a bulky, heavy heat sink is eliminated is key to creating ultra-thin and lightweight lighting products with 2 times longer lifespan through efficient thermal management.As you can see, our HS FRAME technology has not only improved the LED technology and product performance, it allowed us to simplify the production process and reduce the cost by 50%.","Lighting, LED, Special lightings","LED, 조명 기기",201508000000,www.bktechnology.kr,2015-12-22,"BKT’s Vitamin Lamp is a high-intensity discharge (HID) outdoor lamp used for street, park, security, and tunnel lighting.

22217719,202506000000,"1.Summary  Clean-Q is real time hygiene monitoring system. It checks ATP to find out the existence of germs. Traditional method is germ cultivation method. It gets samples and cultivates them for 48~72 hours. But it takes only 10 seconds with Clean-Q to check the contamination and amount of germs.Other method is used to analyze the cause of an accident such as food poisoning after it happens. But our system can be used for preventive purpose.2. Characteristics (1) Made in Korea       ATP measurement devices were quite expensive until 3 years ago. So the use was limited. Teltron introduced a low priced model in 2011. The price is low when it is compared to the quality.        It shows lower tolerance rate compared to foreign products(Kikkoman, Hygiene, and 3M).        It provides fast support and A/S because it is Korean product. (2) Germ cultivation method takes 48~72 hours.    - Clean-Q takes only 10 seconds.       Hygiene level can be checked easily at any time at any place.       It is done in real time so that systematic and efficient hygiene          management is possible.      - It makes public food hygiene safer through regular checking.       It prevents accidents from food contamination. (3) The system can be optimized for easy use.       The operation is simple so anyone can use it.        It can be used for various applications. (4) Systematic management by combining with a PC       It can communicate with a computer using USB port, save data          in the computer, and convert the data into EXCEL file format. (5) Its reliability is proven through many certificates.  (6) Chosen as excellent product by Korea e-Procurement: The excellence of the product is proven.",Laboratory and Testing Equipment,실험 및 테스트 장비,201508000000,www.teltron.com/en/,2017-01-03,"Teltron Corporation's main area of business include development and sales of products leveraging high-frequency band including 10GHz band motion sensor, light-saving control module and 12GHz phase shifter chip for satellite broadcasting, etc. The company is also focusing on developing new products applied with ITBT convergence technology building on its aspirations to lead technological advances."
